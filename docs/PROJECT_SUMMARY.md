# Project Summary: Psychosis

## Current Project State

**Status**: 🟢 Phase 0 - Initialization (In Progress)  
**Last Scanned**: [Current Date]  
**Repository**: ✅ Initialized and pushed to GitHub  
**Xcode Project**: 📁 Structure created, ready for Xcode project file

---

## Project Overview

This is a **starter template** for an Xcode project that will be developed using:
- **Xcode** for building and running
- **Cursor** for AI-assisted coding
- **Git + GitHub** for version control

The project is named **"Psychosis"** - an iOS application built with SwiftUI and MVVM architecture. Initial project structure and architecture decisions have been made.

## Key Documents

### For Planning
- **`PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md`**: Complete 8-phase roadmap from initialization to post-launch maintenance
- **`TODO.md`**: Detailed, actionable to-do lists organized by phase and priority

### For Development
- **`WORKFLOW.md`**: Day-to-day workflow for Xcode + Cursor + GitHub
- **`CURSOR_CONTEXT.md`**: Context and guidelines for AI-assisted development

### For Reference
- **`README.md`**: Project setup and getting started guide
- **`.cursor/rules.md`**: Cursor-specific behavior rules

## Immediate Next Steps

### 🔴 Critical (Do First)
1. **Define Project Requirements**
   - What is the "Psychosis" application?
   - What problem does it solve?
   - Who is the target audience?
   - What are the core features?

2. **Initialize Git Repository**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Project template"
   ```

3. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Create repo on GitHub
   - Add remote and push

4. **Create Xcode Project**
   - Open Xcode
   - Create new project
   - Save in `XcodeProject/` folder

### 🟠 High Priority (Week 1)
- Determine target platform (iOS/macOS/etc.)
- Choose architecture pattern
- Choose UI framework (SwiftUI/UIKit/etc.)
- Set up project structure
- Create architecture documentation

## Notes

- This is a **starter template** - customize as needed for your specific project
- Timeline estimates assume single developer, full-time work
- Adjust phases and timelines based on actual requirements
- Regular reviews and updates to roadmap recommended
- All decisions should be documented in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` once created
