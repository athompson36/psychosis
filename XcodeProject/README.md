# XcodeProject Folder

This is where your actual **Xcode project** lives.

## Steps

1. Open Xcode.
2. Create a new project (or move an existing one) and choose this folder as the destination.
3. Ensure that your `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` ends up here, e.g.:

```text
XcodeProject/
  MyApp.xcodeproj
  MyApp/
    AppDelegate.swift
    ContentView.swift
    ...
```

Once that’s done:

- Commit the changes with Git.
- Push to GitHub.
- Open the repo root in Cursor to work with the assistant on this project.
